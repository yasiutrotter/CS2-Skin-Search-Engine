# CS2 Skin Search Engine

A web application designed to help users search for their favorite Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) skins and view all the relevant details. The project is built as a personal learning experience to explore frontend development with modern web technologies.

The app is created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Features

- **Skin Search:** Easily search for any existing CS2 skin or weapon by name.
- **Skin Details Page:** Click on any skin from the search results to see its full details, including its image, weapon name, full skin name, and soon, additional information like the cases from which it can drop and its rarity.

## Planned Features:

- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Filter Options:** Soon, you'll be able to filter search results by weapon, skin, or rarity.
- **Case Lookup:** Youâ€™ll be able to search for cases and see which skins are available in those cases.

## Technologies

- **Next.js:** A powerful React framework for building SSR (Server-Side Rendering) applications with routing capabilities.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that makes the code easier to manage and less prone to errors.
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid, customizable UI design.

## API Used
